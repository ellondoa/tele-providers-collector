# Xray Proxy Grabber

###### **Attention:** by now we only support secure layers proxies like `TLS` and `Reality`. 

###### **See more:** And also explore this project: [xray-iran-bridge-configs](https://github.com/MrMohebi/xray-iran-bridge-configs) :)
 

## Explanation
This project is aimed at grabbing fresh proxies from Telegram channels and testing them by real-delay ping.
A Telegram bot will listen on provided channels (even private ones), then parse new proxies and commit them to ur repo.

The main differences between this project and others are:
- creating xray json config from urls (I'll explain what this is for :) )
- can grab proxies from private channels or even PVs (with some little changes).
- AND to-dos that will be added :)

### Telegram grabber:
Uses the Telegram MTProto API Framework and acts exactly like ur real account. After first running,
It will ask u to sign in to your account. then listens to the provided channel in [`env`](./.env.example#L12).

Because of that, it can grab proxies everywhere that u join them with ur real account, even PVs :)
To get started with the MTProto API, u should get `app_id` and `api_hash` which I couldn't get them easily.
###### *Note:* Telegram detects u'r using a VPN and throws an error while creating `app_id` :|. Ask someone to create it for u.(God bless Telegram.)

On each new message that contains a proxy URL, [`proxies_row_url.txt`](collected-proxies/row-url/all.txt) will be updated real-time.

###### *Tip:* u can use [`proxies_row_url.txt`](collected-proxies/row-url/all.txt) as subscription link in ur clients app (V2rayNG, V2rayN, etc):)


### Xray URL Decoder
This [part of project](./xray_url_decoder) aimed to decode and convert proxy URL to python class witch can be played with.
Because of this part I only support `vless` 

I couldn't find it anywhere. Really nobody wrote it before !? :| 

If u know any repo done this before, notify me, tnx.


### Xray ping
To test grabbed proxies, be only relied on ping of server on that port is not a correct approach.

In [this part](./xray_ping) I run a xray-core temporarily, witch trys to GET a simple html page by real connection throw proxy.

Also, nobody wrote it before. Come on guys.

### Auto Run Jobs 
[`checkProxies.py`](./checkProxies.py) will be run every 30 minutes by the GitHub runner and check for grabbed proxies to be active.
Next, sort these proxies by real delay ping and save them as JSON type in [`proxies_active.txt`](collected-proxies/xray-json/actives_all.txt)
###### *Note:* GitHub runners aren't in Iran, So proxy checker can't detect censored proxies. U can run it on ur server from Iran by cron jobs.


[`cleanProxiesRowUrl.py`](./cleanProxiesRowUrl.py) will be run each 12 hours by GitHub runner and remove all URL proxies witch are not present in [`proxies_active.txt`](collected-proxies/xray-json/actives_all.txt).
So the url list will be clean always
###### *Note:* It means only supported protocols will remain, and all others will be deleted.



## Env-File:
To commit new proxies in ur repo, u should get [GitHub token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#personal-access-tokens-classic)So the bot will be able to commit new changes, such as new proxies.

Also, I explained How to get `api_id` [here](#telegram-grabber)

## ToDo
- [x] vless protocol support
- [x] reality security support
- [x] vmess protocol support
- [x] trojan protocol support
- [x] connect to iran bridge
- [x] update iran bridge with actives
- [ ] tcp security support
- [ ] server less grabber (no telegram or server needed)
